we'll use pythons built-in set class to perform the intersection and union. in the case of union we'll add the values from both lists to a set, which ill give us a union, then iterate over the set and add the values to a linked list in the case of intersection we'll add the values from each lists to a set,then intersect them, then iterate over the resulting set and add the values to a linked list

* Union: Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n)
* intersection: Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n)
